# Noodles.Fun ‚Äî Feed Your KOLs! üçú

**Noodles.Fun** turns Twitter (X) accounts into special bonding curve tokens. Trade these tokens and use them to pay for promotion services on X, such as shoutouts or pinned tweets. A fun way to support and engage with KOLs!

## How It Works

1. **Every Twitter Account Has a Token:** Each token represents a unique bonding curve for a Twitter (X) account.
2. **Trade Instantly:** Use a bonding curve to buy or sell tokens. No need for liquidity pools or order books.
3. **Spend Tokens for Promotions:** The X account owner can accept tokens as payment for services, such as tweets or pinned posts.
